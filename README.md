# Text_Classification_for_Marketing

The goal of this project is to discover and extract meaningful topics from large collections of texual data, such as Amazon reviews, using topic modeling. By analyzing the text of the reviews, topic modeling algorithms can identify the underlying patterns and group together similar reviews that revolve around common topics. This enables us to gain insights into the main subjects of discussion within the reviews, allowing us to understand customer preferences, identify product strengths and weaknesses, and perform market research.
